      Today's experiments involve testing the grounds out of Vital, a virtual synthesizer software, and exploring my resonances with some of the default sounds within this library.
<br><br>
<h3>Vital Experiment 1</h3>

I first wanted to find a sound within here that I didn't resonate with, and while there were quite a few in this library, this was the most significant outlier of the pack. There are two aspects I didn't like about this. The first was how the timing of the arpeggiated notes within the synthesizer. There wasn't much consistency for them, and it felt like it was just an aspect of unpredictable randomness that would be useful in some situations; however, even still, that would be in an extreme niche case. Similarly, I also didn't resonate with the actual notes that the arpeggiated notes were. While the pad in the background was the note I selected, the other notes playing were off-key, which, again, would have some applications but would be highly niche.
<br><br>
<h3>Vital Experiment 2</h3>

Like the first experiment, I wanted to see some of the other arpeggiators in this pack. This leads me to this sound. I particularly enjoy how flat the sound is, which really can lead to developing some exciting melodies when you play around with some of the notes and melodies within this synth, as you can hear some slight experimentation on my half within this experiment. The other aspect of this is how the arpeggiator returns to the original note every second tone to provide that consistency.

<h3>Vital Experiment 3</h3>

Now, I wanted to change pace drastically. This sound is almost 180 from the previous sound, incorporating a significant amount of delay and removing the arpeggiator. I particularly enjoy how commanding this synth sound is. Having a solid hit with some slight tonal variation in the attack and such an extended delay helps with this.
<br><br>
<h3>Vital Experiment 4</h3>

In this experiment, I wanted to try out a bass sound. While I immensely enjoy the depth of this sound, I'm not a huge fan of the attack. Because of this, I actually held the notes rather than releasing each note, as this removed the attack part I didn't like. However, I really enjoy the rest of the sound due to how deep this sound is.
