      To summarise all the insights I received from Cy and fellow students from my assignment, there is a lack of research that backs the design and thought process behind all the ideas proposed throughout the text. For each idea I suggested, there was generally only one piece of evidence supporting this idea. Additionally, there was a lot of content lacking from the online blog posts, which I plan to make a change for going forward with assignment two (if selecting the tags on the blog main page, you should be able to see more in the assignment two categories, compared to assignment one… or at least I hope from the time of writing this). Cy also mentioned how I should include more on how I feel about each idea and concept, beyond just a stately “business” oriented project.

      Something I’ve also found interesting between Cy's responses to my proposal and those of fellow students is that the classmates seem to see the idea more clearly. Various factors could be behind this, varying from the general type of content each generation consumes. Still, a genuine possibility is that students don’t necessarily look into the ideas as much as a lecturer would. So, from now on, I think I will need to present a bit more clearly how each objective in the design will be met. Luckily, I already have a lot of experience from this due to the six years I’ve built the Off the Dial brand from scratch.
