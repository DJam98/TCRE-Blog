      In this post, we’re going to review a few of the psychology articles and break them down into how I understand them! So, let’s go woooo!
<br><br>
      <h3>Salience</h3>

<br><br>

The first sentence really boils it down to one idea, which the article's first sentence puts quite simply; “the property by which something stands out”. It’s quite similar to the design principle of hierarchy but almost in a broader sense. The biggest thing to take out of this is how well salience can emphasise areas and bring attention to them using tools such as colour, size and position. For example, having a red circle on a black background will be more noticeable (and therefore more salience) than if the circle was dark grey.

Since one of my biggest focuses with this task is to design for accessibility, this is a really big part of this, as when you’re designing for accessibility, you can’t always rely on one design tool, such as colour. So, I’ll definitely be taking this into consideration when going into my design!
<br><br>
<h3>Priming</h3>

<i>Based on readings from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">this Wikipedia article</a> <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)</i>

<br><br>

Priming is having preliminary stimuli affect the stimuli immediately following the preliminary. What I find intriguing about this is how this isn’t always a ‘positive’ impact and can be negative so that it’s more shocking and surprising for the viewer (this is probably used for horror films).

I will very likely only be using positive priming in my project, as the idea is that I’m enhancing the viewer’s experience, so I'm almost exaggerating what they would expect to see.
