        <h3>Sachi</h3>
Sachi's response was very insightful, with quite a few notes that I will take into account moving forward with this class
<br><br>
<h4>Squares Task</h4>
Sachi's take on this task demonstrates a great understanding of the task, not only from the actual work that has been completed but also from their own textual responses, which give a clear understanding of why they've made each of those design decisions. This strikes me in particular because I've always struggled with explaining why I do things beyond technical reasons, so seeing a great response to the design's thought process is an excellent way to see how this is done.
<br><br>
I particularly enjoy her exploration of the "Fragile" theme. Initially, they used a black colour scheme, but then they shifted towards a more dangerous red and spaced the squares further apart to exemplify fragility.
<br><br>
<h4>Reading Responses</h4>
Something that was in Sachi's response that I didn't take into account when looking at the <i>Affective Theory</i> article is how planetary orbits (and in particular their moons) are an excellent way of depicting how Affective Resonance works.

<h3>Cameron</h3>
<h4>Squares Task</h4>
What I find interesting about Cameron's response is that they only use one type of colour scheme and explore all the themes with that dark blue / purple colour scheme.
