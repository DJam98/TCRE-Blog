        <h3>Sachi</h3>
        Sachi's response was very insightful, with quite a few notes that I will take into account moving forward with this class
        <br><br>
        <h4>Squares Task</h4>
        Sachi's take on this task demonstrates a great understanding of the task, not only from the actual work that has been completed but also from their own textual responses, which give a clear understanding of why they've made each of those design decisions. This strikes me in particular because I've always struggled to explain why I do things beyond technical reasons, so seeing a great response to the design's thought process is an excellent way to see how this is done.
        <br><br>
        I particularly enjoy her exploration of the "Fragile" theme. Initially, they used a black colour scheme, but then they shifted towards a more dangerous red and spaced the squares further apart to exemplify fragility.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Reading Responses</h4>
        Something that was in Sachi's response that I didn't take into account when looking at the <i>Affective Theory</i> article is how planetary orbits (and in particular their moons) are an excellent way of depicting how Affective Resonance works.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Cameron</h3>
        <h4>Squares Task</h4>
        What I find interesting about Cameron's response is that they only use one type of colour scheme (almost monochromatic) and explore all the themes with that dark blue/purple colour scheme. I particularly like the congested theme because the squares are not only so close together within the tight space, but they're also congested because all of the shapes share very similar colours.
        
        <br><br>
        <h4>Reading Responses</h4>
        Cameron's main interpretation of the text was that Affective Resonance can be observed in many different forms. Similarly to Sachi, Cameron also noted that the solar system interaction and rotations are just a grander version of Affective resonance.
