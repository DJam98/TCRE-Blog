      My design process has always followed a familiar path. I start with a central idea, then move on to typeface and colour scheme selection, initial sketches, and finally, the actual project. However, this class and the project that has been evolving throughout the semester have challenged me to step out of my comfort zone and explore new approaches.
      <br><br>
      For this project, the central idea was to construct a graphic package for a competitive organisation for the game 'THE FINALS', with a significant focus on creating the brand 'Showtime'. It took me some time to fully grasp the true intention of this assignment. It wasn't about crafting a typical finished work, as much as I would have preferred that. The real intention was to design something that would genuinely stir emotions in the audience. This shift in perspective has been a profound learning experience for me.
      <br><br>
      While it may be a little late in the journey to make any significant changes actually to reflect what I've learned here, it has certainly given me some insight into how I might approach designing projects in the future when considering colour resonance transformation.
