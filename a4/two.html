      Showtime is a testament to the power of a curated event to captivate an audience, a stark contrast to a scenario where only gameplay is shown. This innovative work is the product of a seamless integration of various digital software tools, including Affinity Designer, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Adobe Animate, and Open Broadcast Software (OBS). Showtime, a comprehensive production package, is designed to enhance the viewing experience of a competitive event set in THE FINALS, a video game by Embark Studios and published by Nexon. It is meticulously structured to ensure the audience's excitement peaks and dips at specific moments during the broadcast.
Furthermore, in a live production, commentators would be present to further elevate this experience.
