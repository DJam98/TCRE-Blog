      The area that I've focused the most on has been the intro countdown, as it's the area that can show the 'hype sine wave' very explicitly without needing any commentary to enhance it, which is required for most other scenes. This was also the aspect I got the most feedback on, as this was one of the only moderately completed sections by the end of Assignment Two.

      <h3>Version 1</h3>
      <br>

      <br>
      
      The main feedback I received was that the blue and red colour changes felt impactful, but the colour change to yellow felt less satisfying. Now, let's take a look at how I changed this.
      
      <br><br>
      <h3>Version 2</h3>
      <br>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5f04kDe-tXw?si=_o02kVPmiRStMAoH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br>
      
      In this version, I experimented with changing the colour to see if I could find some colour combinations that resonated better with me. While I played around with various different colours, I couldn't seem to find one that really worked well together with the prior blue and red.
      
      <br><br>
      
      Something else I added to this version was the static glitch effect. This was to add a bit of texture to the start of the countdown when the background is pure black because I found that sometimes when the screen is pure black, I lack interest and look away from itâ€” an undesirable outcome.

      <h3>Version 3</h3>
      <br>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPJ1kYDiFZ8?si=_6ijXy-DvSUpOrui" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br>
      
      I can almost hear you shouting, "Why did you switch back to yellow if you already wrote it off"? After doing those experiments in version 2, I found that there wasn't a good colour to replace it, so I had another look at it, and really, it was the timing that was the most unsatisfying part of it. If you compare the duration of each colour, you will find that the red was on screen for the shortest time. By changing this and reducing the time yellow is on screen, I found this was a more satisfying experience.
      
      However, the colour yellow still did not satisfy me, so to help relieve this, I decided to make the static glitch change colours to reflect the primary colour on the screen. With this added level of texture, I found that the yellow was now enjoyable.
